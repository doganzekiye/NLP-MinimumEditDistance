# NLP-MinimumEditDistance
The project was developed to find the minimum number of operations required to convert two words to each other and what these operations are.

Part1: Implement a MED algorithm with a user interface, which takes input as a ‘word’ and lists its first 5 alternative correct words (list nearest 5 words) by using the dictionary given.

Part2: For given two words, find the MED value of transforming from first word to second, show the steps in a table and write the operations’ names needed to transform
